	<h2>1. Soul Wandering</h2>

	[Instrumental]


	<h2>2. Lugburz</h2>

	<p>Cold be hand and heart and bone,<br/>
	and cold be sleep under stone: never more to wake<br/>
	on stony bed, never, till the sun fails<br/>
	and the moon is dead.<br/><br/>

	In the black wind the stars shall die,<br/>
	and still on gold here let them lie,<br/>
	till the dark lord lifts his hand<br/>
	over dead sea and withered land<br/><br/>

	[1]<br/>
	When the winter first begins to bite<br/>
	and stones crack in the frosty night,<br/>
	when pools are black and trees are bare,<br/>
	it is evil in the wild to fare.<br/><br/>

	[repeat 2 first lines of the verse]<br/><br/>

	To lay down my will upon the Land, Lugbûrz<br/><br/>

	No sound disturbs this place of blackened souls<br/>
	This winter walls of stone and ice behold thy might<br/>
	Again I'm kneeling down to hear these strange tunes of war<br/>
	Night, oh beloved night, your wisdom floats into my mind,<br/>
	and forms my thoughts of Middle-Earth<br/>
	to build up a new mighty empire<br/><br/>

	[Repeat 1]</p>


	<h2>3. Passing Of The Grey Company</h2>

	<p>Over the land there lies a long shadow,<br/>
	westward reaching wings of darkness.<br/>
	The tower trembles, to the tombs of kings<br/>
	doom approaches. The dead awaken,<br/><br/>

	for the hour is come for the oathbreakers;<br/>
	at the stone of Erech they shall stand again<br/>
	and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.<br/>
	Whose shall the horn be?<br/>
	Who shall call them from grey twilight, the forgotten people?<br/><br/>

	the heir of him to whom the oath they swore.<br/>
	From the North shall he come, need shall drive him.<br/>
	He shall pass the door to the path of the dead.<br/><br/>

	On your knees...<br/>
	The grey company is arriving now...</p>


	<h2>4. Morthond</h2>

	<p>We heard horns in hills ringing<br/>
	The swords shining in South-kingdom<br/>
	Steeds went striding to the Stoningland<br/>
	As winds in morning. War was there.<br/><br/>

	Drowning in dark waters, meres of Morthond<br/>
	beneath the mountain shadows<br/>
	Death in the morning and at day's ending<br/>
	Lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep.<br/><br/>

	Grey now as tears gleaming silver<br/>
	Red then it rolled roaring water<br/>
	Foam dyed with blood, flamed at a sunset<br/>
	As bacon mountains burned at evening</p>


	<h2>5. Marching Homewards</h2>

	<p>here beside me, under endless howling winds<br/>
	my dying race is wandering homewards,<br/>
	led by an old man to shores that don't exist,<br/>
	just emptiness remains...<br/><br/>

	on and on goes our march gruesome as the light of sun, cold as winds that hide in me<br/><br/>

	hour after hour, day after day my lullaby is turning and falls gently on this sleeping land<br/>
	like a hawk trembling of hunger and like a burning source...<br/><br/>

	two years have passed and still my race is wandering through foreign shores...<br/>
	homewards....<br/><br/>

	My soul is now formed as a knife forwards the heart of your heaven.<br/>
	And so I die...<br/><br/>

	Still my folk keeps on marching...<br/>
	homewards...</p>


	<h2>6. Orthanc</h2>

	<p>[Instrumental]</p>


	<h2>7. Ungolianth</h2>

	<p>Come to me lady of a foreign shore<br/>
	to pass on your knowledge to me,<br/>
	interrupt these peaceful lands with your odem of pestilence<br/>
	Your lifeform is living in the deepest twilight,<br/>
	the depths of Avathar.<br/><br/>

	Your odem goes down the green rivers and<br/>
	high up to the blue skies, to the wide open forests and<br/>
	mountains so high, far away to the unknown and<br/>
	at last to destroy the two trees of life on<br/>
	the hills of Ezellohar...<br/><br/>

	So high my throne, so cold as ice<br/>
	it makes my blue eyes turn red<br/>
	and this red covers my stronghold Angband<br/>
	as a shadow fog to keep it unseen...<br/>
	The Silmaril now covers my crown<br/><br/>

	Keep away Ungolianth...</p>


	<h2>8. Dagor Bragollach</h2>

	<p>In the year 455 it began, the battle of rapid fire.<br/>
	Announced threw flames,<br/>
	more deadly then the third battle.<br/>
	Streams of fire flowing out of Thangorodrin and burned Ardgalen<br/>
	And with the flame a see of orcs arived,<br/>
	and balorgs and glaurung the dragon.<br/>
	Having received all his might now Dor Thonion broke down first under this onset<br/>
	Angrod and aegnor where killed and their folk enslaved.<br/>
	The riders of maglor where sacrifices of the flames.<br/>
	On the planes of Lothlann victory on our side the triumph of Morgoth.</p>


	<h2>9. Through The Forest Of Dol Guldur</h2>

	<p>A misty path through woods long past and shrined in silence<br/>
	and runes will keep the secrets of Dol Guldur<br/>
	Far away and over the cold fold mountains<br/>
	our gleaming eyes are searching for a sign<br/>
	and down to the deepest dungeons<br/>
	and to the old forgotten lair<br/>
	We must leave now, before a new day breaks<br/>
	to search for the pale gold<br/>
	that once belonged to the forest<br/><br/>

	By the sounds of pounding hammers<br/>
	that sound like bells of the elves in our ears...<br/>
	we are still searching in the underground<br/>
	where our dark secrets sleep</p>


	<h2>10. The Legend Of The Master-Ring</h2>

	<p>Three rings to elven kings<br/>
	Under the sky,<br/>
	seven for the dwarf lords<br/>
	in their halls of stone<br/>
	Nine for mortal men<br/>
	doomed to die<br/>
	One for the Dark Lord<br/>
	on his dark throne<br/><br/>

	In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie<br/>
	One Ring to rule them all<br/>
	One Ring to find them<br/>
	One Ring to bring them all<br/>
	And in darkness bind them<br/>
	In the land of Mordor where shadows lie<br/><br/>

	The earth was trembling by cloven hooves<br/>
	and no stars shined in that night<br/>
	foreseen the Morgul road<br/>
	was hidden by clouds of doom...<br/>
	and trembled again by the outburst of darkness.<br/>
	Ten thousand orcs and trolls,<br/>
	paralyzed with fear<br/>
	of the nazgûl king ???<br/>
	One ring to rule them all<br/>
	In the gathering of darkness<br/>
	In the lands of Mordor where the shadows Lie</p>


	<h2>11. Dor Daedeloth</h2>

	<p>My heart for your word, Ered Engrin,<br/>
	and watch your folk, tired and small<br/>
	all hope lies in its last breath...<br/><br/>

	You won't fear us, for we won't bring you anything<br/>
	but a fading spirit,<br/>
	the essence of my frost cries...<br/><br/>

	frost and ice destroy...<br/><br/>

	My heart for your word, Dor Daedeloth,<br/>
	You have seen the journey of time,<br/>
	and let us half mortal beings,<br/>
	take part of the truth<br/>
	and the solitude of mankind, forever.<br/><br/>

	Wherever we go, wherever we stand,<br/>
	silence covers the blood soaken land,<br/>
	and so we pass the mountains of Ered Gorgoroth.<br/><br/>

	Five silhouettes are crossing the planes<br/>
	to the wide opened forest of the west,<br/>
	on and on they are traveling<br/>
	in the direction of Hithlum<br/>
	called Nebelland that made me a King for eternity.</p>
