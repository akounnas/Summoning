<h3>1. Tar-Calion</h3>

<p>[Instrumental]</p>

<h3>2. Silvertine</h3>

<p>High on the mountains highest ridge<br/>
Where oft the stormy winter gale<br/>
Cuts life a scythe, while through the clouds<br/>
It sweeps from vale to vale;<br/>
Not five yards from the mountain path,<br/>
Silvertine you on the left espy;<br/>
And to the left, three yards beyond,<br/>
You see a little muddy pound.<br/><br/>

I looked around, I thought I saw<br/>
A jutting crag, and off I ran,<br/>
Head-foremost, through the driving rain,<br/>
The shelter of the crag to gain;<br/>
And, as I am a man,<br/>
Instead a jutting crag, I found<br/>
Durins tower up from the ground...</p>

<h3>3. Carcharoth</h3>

<p>Upon the threshold, watchful, dire,<br/>
His eyes new-kindled with dull fire,<br/>
His teeth were bare, his tongue aflame,<br/>
Aroused he watched the no one came,<br/><br/>

No flitting shade nor hunted shape,<br/>
Seeking from Angband to escape.<br/>
Now past that guard what guile or might<br/>
Could thrust from death into the light?<br/><br/>

As gleam of swords in fire there flashed<br/>
The fangs of Carcharoth, and crashed<br/>
Together like a trap, and tore<br/>
His hand about the wrist, and shore</p>

<h3>4. Herumor (7:08)</h3>

<p>From every depth of good and ill<br/>
The mystery which binds me still:<br/>
From the torrent, or the fountain,<br/>
From the red cliff of the mountain,<br/><br/>

From the sun that round me rolled<br/>
In its autumn tint of gold,<br/>
From the lightning in the sky<br/>
As it passed me flying by,<br/><br/>

From the thunder and the storm,<br/>
And the cloud that took the form<br/>
From the same source I have not taken<br/>
My sorrow; I could not awaken<br/>
My heart to joy at the same tone;<br/>
And all I loved, I loved alone.<br/><br/>

On the brink of the abyss<br/>
with a blindfold tied tight<br/>
should I step into the mist<br/>
or retreat back to the light?<br/><br/>

I don't know what is in there<br/>
whether it be ground or a fall<br/>
I don't know if I shall dare<br/>
to take the step and risk it all...</p>

<h3>5. Barrow-downs</h3>

<p>[Instrumental]</p>

<h3>6. Night Fell Behind</h3>

<p>Then mounte! Then mounte, brave gallants, all,<br/>
And don your helmes amaine:<br/>
Deathes couriers, fame and honor, call<br/>
Us to the field again.<br/><br/>

No shrewish tears shall fill our eye<br/>
When the sword hilts in our hand,<br/>
Heart-whole well part and no white sighe<br/>
For the fairest of the land;<br/><br/>

Let piping swaine, and craven wight,<br/>
thus wheepe and puling crye<br/>
Our business is life men to fight,<br/>
And hero life to die!</p>

<h3>7. Mirklands</h3>

<p>Good bye, proud world! I'm going home,<br/>
Thou art not my friend, and I'm not thine;<br/>
Long through thy weary crowds I roam;<br/>
Long I've been tossed like the driven foam,<br/>
But now, proud world! I'm going home.<br/><br/>

I am going to my own hearth stone<br/>
Bosomed in yon green hills, alone,<br/>
A secret nook in a pleasant land,<br/>
Whose groves the frolic fairies planned<br/><br/>

Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face,<br/>
To Grandeur, with his wise grimace,<br/>
To frozen hearts, and hasting feet,<br/>
To those who go, and those who come,<br/>
Good-bye, proud world, I'm going home.</p>

<h3>8. With Doom I Come</h3>

<p>And shadowy shapes did stare and roam<br/>
Beneath the dark and starry dome<br/>
That hung above the dawn of Earth<br/>
And shaken it with silver mirth<br/><br/>

In later days when Morgoth first<br/>
Fleeing the Gods, their bondage burst<br/>
And on the mortal lands set feet<br/>
Far in the north on his mighty seat<br/><br/>

There once, and long and long ago<br/>
Before the sun and moon we know<br/>
Were lit to sail above the world<br/>
When first the shaggy woods unfurled<br/><br/>

There once, and long and long ago<br/>
Before the sun and moon we know<br/>
Were lit to sail above the world<br/>
When first the shaggy woods unfurled<br/><br/>

And shadowy shapes did stare and roam<br/>
Beneath the dark and starry dome<br/>
That hung above the dawn of Earth<br/>
And shaken it with silver mirth<br/><br/>

In later days when Morgoth first,<br/>
Fleeing the Gods, their bondage burst<br/>
And on the mortal lands set feet<br/>
Far in the north on his mighty seat<br/><br/>

There once, and long and long ago<br/>
Before the sun and moon we know<br/>
Were lit to sail above the world<br/>
When first the shaggy woods unfurled<br/><br/>

There once, and long and long ago<br/>
Before the sun and moon we know<br/>
Were lit to sail above the world<br/>
When first the shaggy woods unfurled<br/><br/>

Death to light, to law, to love<br/>
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above<br/>
May darkness everlasting old<br/>
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun<br/><br/>

Death to light, to law, to love<br/>
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above<br/>
May darkness everlasting old<br/>
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun<br/><br/>

Death to light, to law, to love<br/>
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above<br/>
May darkness everlasting old<br/>
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun<br/><br/>

Death to light, to law, to love<br/>
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above<br/>
May darkness everlasting old<br/>
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun</p>
