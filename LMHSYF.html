<h3><a name="1">1. A New Power Is Rising</a></h3><br>
<i>[inscription on the ring:]</i><br>
<br>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul<br>
ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul<br>
<br>
<i>[translation from the black speech:]</i><br>
<br>
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.]<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="2">2. South Away</a></h3><br>
Leave the halls and caverns deep<br>
Were the forests wide and dim<br>
Stoops in shadow grey and grim<br>
<br>
Float beyond the world of trees<br>
Past the rushes, past the reeds<br>
Past the marshes, weaving weeds<br>
<br>
...and the crowns of the seven kings, and the rods of the five wizards...<br>
South away! South away now!<br>
Far away seek the sunlight and the day.<br>
<br>
Hail, Éomer, king of the mark.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="3">3. In Hollow Halls Beneath The Fells</a></h3><br>
Far over the misty mountains cold<br>
To dungeons deep and carvens old<br>
We must away ere break of day<br>
To seek the pale enchanted gold<br>
<br>
The pines were roaring on the height<br>
The winds were moaning in the night<br>
The fire was read, it flaming spread<br>
The trees like torches blazed with light<br>
<br>
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells<br>
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br>
In places deep where dark things sleep<br>
In hollow halls beneath the fells<br>
<br>
For ancient kind and elvish lord<br>
There many a gleaming golden hord<br>
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught<br>
To hide in gems on hilt of sword<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample:1. In the darkness bind them]</i><br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="4">4. Our Foes Shall Fall</a></h3><br>
The sword is sharp, the spear is long<br>
The arrow swift, the gate is strong<br>
The heart is bold that looks on gold<br>
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong<br>
<br>
The mountain throne once more is freed<br>
O! Wandering fold, the summons heed<br>
Come haste! Come haste! Across the waste<br>
The king of friend and kin has need.<br>
<br>
Now call we over mountains cold<br>
Come back unto the caverns old<br>
Here at the gates the king awaits<br>
His hands are rich with gems and gold<br>
<br>
The king is come unto his hall<br>
Under the mountain dark and tall<br>
The worm of dread is slain and dead<br>
And ever so our foes shall fall<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="5">5. The Mountain King's Return</a></h3><br>
The king beneath the mountains<br>
The king of carven stone<br>
The lord of silver fountains<br>
Shall come into his own!<br>
<br>
His crown shall be upholden<br>
His harp shall be restrung<br>
His halls shall echo golden<br>
To songs of yore resung<br>
<br>
The woods shall wave on mountains<br>
And grass beneath the sun<br>
His wealth shall flow in fountains<br>
And rivers golden run<br>
<br>
The streams shall run in gladness<br>
The lakes shall shine and burn<br>
All sorrow fail and sadness<br>
At mountains king's return<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br>
<i>[1. War has already begun ... so, we come to it in the end.]</i><br>
<i>[2. Follow me threw the darkness.]</i><br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="6">6. Runes Of Power</a></h3><br>
The wind came down from mountain could<br>
And like a tide it roared and rolled<br>
The branches groaned, the forest moaned<br>
And leaves were laid upon the mould<br>
<br>
The wind went on from West to east<br>
All movement in the forest ceased<br>
But shrill an harsh across the marsh<br>
Its whistling voices were released<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br>
<i>[1. And runes of power upon the door. There shone forever, fair and bright]</i><br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="7">7. Ashen Cold</a></h3><br>
A grin and a word is his trade<br>
From these his profit is made<br>
Though his body is not tall and his courage seems small<br>
His fame will take longer to fade<br>
<br>
Beyond the ocean brews a battle<br>
Beyond the battle blood shall fall<br>
To a place where man forsaken<br>
Dwells the one who should not live<br>
<br>
Then a bargain shall be entered<br>
Saurons might shall be restored<br>
You and we were first to conquer<br>
You and we shall be the last.<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br>
<i>[1. The world is grey, the mountain's old. The forges fire is ashen cold.]</i><br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="8">8. Farewell</a></h3><br>
Who can find you clear springs of waters, but I can!<br>
Who can tell you the age of the moon, but I can!<br>
Who can call the fish from the depths of the sea, yes I can!<br>
Who can change the shapes of the hills and the headlands, I can!<br>
<br>
I have been a sword in the hand,<br>
I have been a shield in a fight,<br>
I have been the string of a harp,<br>
I can shift my shape like a god.<br>
<br>
Farewell, leave the shore to an ocean wide and untamed<br>
Hold your shield high, let the wind bring your enemy your nightmare<br>
By the bane of my blade, a mighty spell is made and<br>
Far beyond the battle blood shall fall like a hard rain.<br>
<br>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br>
<i>[1. And at the gates the trumpets rang.]</i><br>
<i>[2. This is my hour. Do you not know death when you see it  die now!]</i><br>
