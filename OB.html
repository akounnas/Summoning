<h3><a name="1">1. Bauglir</a></h3><br>
<i>[Morgoth:]</i><br>
Sit now there,<br>
And look out upon the lands<br>
Where evil and despair shall come upon those whom thou lovest.<br>
<br>
Thou hast dared to mock me, and to question the power of Melkor,<br>
Master of the fates of Arda.<br>
<br>
Therefore, with my eyes thou shalt see,<br>
And with my ears thou shall hear;<br>
And never shalt thou move from this place<br>
Until all is fulfilled unto its bitter end...<br>
<br>
<i>[Orcs:]</i><br>
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!<br>
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!<br>
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!<br>
Lord and Master! Lord and Master!<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="2">2. Across The Streaming Tide</a></h3><br>
In autumn when the wind and sea<br>
Rejoice to live and laugh to be<br>
And scarce the blast that curbs the tree<br>
And bids before it quail and flee<br>
<br>
In winter when years when the years burn low<br>
As fire wherein no firebrands glow<br>
And winds disappear as they blow<br>
The stormy wings of snow<br>
<br>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br>
The hearts of western elves burn bright<br>
With joy that mocks the spring<br>
To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring<br>
Music, that bites the spirit, sing<br>
<br>
And wind by night in northern lands<br>
Arose, and Lord it cried<br>
And drove the ships from ancient strands<br>
Across the streaming tide<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="3">3. Mirdautas Vras</a></h3><br>
<i>[Written in black language of Mordor]</i><br>

<i>[Translation (Narrator is Sauron):]</i><br>
<br>
A Good Day To Kill<br>
<br>
Dark have been my dreams of late<br>
Of secret doubt and secret fear<br>
A thousand years have passed away<br>
To lay down doom and terror<br>
<br>
To north ride on, a thousand orcs<br>
On wolves with giant bloody fangs<br>
They take the storm and power<br>
Of Mordor through the world<br>
<br>
Fire and Ice, the Nazgûl fly<br>
It is a good day to kill!<br>
(Painted) red is Earth and sky<br>
Even Manwe will bow down<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="4">4. Might And Glory</a></h3><br>
Rivers of fire at dead of night<br>
In winter lying cold and white<br>
Upon the plain burst forth, and high.<br>
The red was mirrored in the sky.<br>
<br>
From Hitblum's walls they saw the fire,<br>
The steam and smoke in spire on spire<br>
Leap up, till in confusion vast<br>
The stars were choked. And so it past<br>
<br>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br>
There trumpets sang both long and loud,<br>
And challenge rang unto the cloud<br>
That lay on Morgoth's northem tower,<br>
While Morgoth waits for his hour.<br>
<br>
<i>[Choir:]</i><br>
Might and glory flaming for changing dawn<br>
Ancient power revealed of an iron crown<br>
<br>
Clear and cold and shining so far and bright<br>
Crush the world in one clash of your binding light<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="5">5. Beleriand</a></h3><br>
To north, to north there lay the land of dread<br>
Dungorthin, where all ways were dead<br>
In hills, in hills of shadow bleak and cold<br>
Beyond was deadly nighshades hold<br>
<br>
To south, to south the wide earth unexplored<br>
To west, to west the ancient ocean roared<br>
To east, to east in peaks of blue were piled<br>
The mountains of the outer world.<br>
<br>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br>
<br>
Unsailed and shoreless, wide and wild<br>
To east in peaks of blue were piled<br>
In silence folded, mist enfurled<br>
The mountains of the outer world<br>
<br>
Beyond the tangled, woodland shade<br>
Thorn and thicket grove and glade<br>
Whose brooding boughs with magic hung<br>
Were ancient when the world was young<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="6">6. Northward</a></h3><br>
The wind is cold and heavy<br>
And storms are in the sky<br>
Our path across the nordland<br>
Goes higher and more high<br>
<br>
To left the sea we came from<br>
To right the white hills with no tree.<br>
The wind is growing colder<br>
And shivering are we.<br>
<br>
We drag with stiffening fingers<br>
Our swords and up the hill<br>
The path is steep and tangled<br>
But leads to battles still<br>
<br>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br>
<br>
Farewell now mountain vale and plain<br>
Farewell now wind and frost and rain<br>
And mist and cloud and heavens air<br>
Ye star and moon so blinding fair.<br>
<br>
Farewell now blade and bloom and grass<br>
That see the changing season pass<br>
Farewell sweet earth and northern sky<br>
Forever blessed but here we die.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="7">7. Menegroth</a></h3><br>
A king there was in days of the old<br>
Ere men yet walked upon the mould<br>
His power was reared in caverns shade<br>
His hand was over glen and glade<br>
<br>
His shields were shining as the moon<br>
His lances keen of steel were hewn<br>
Of silver grey his crown was wrought<br>
The starlight in his banners caught<br>
<br>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br>
<br>
And silver thrilled his trumpets long<br>
Beneath the stars in challenge strong<br>
Enchantment did his realm enfold<br>
Where might and glory wealth untold<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="8">8. Land Of The Dead</a></h3><br>
Where the forest stream went through the wood<br>
And silent all the stems there stood<br>
Of tall trees, moveless, hanging dark<br>
With mottled shadows on their bark<br>
<br>
<i>[2x]</i><br>
No moon is there, no voice, no sound<br>
Of beating heart; a sigh profound<br>
Once in each age as each age dies<br>
Alone is heard. Far, far it lies,<br>
As each age dies<br>
<br>
As faint as a deep sleeper's breath<br>
An echo came as cold as death:<br>
Long are the paths, of shadow made<br>
Where no foot's print is ever laid<br>
<br>
<i>[2x]</i><br>
No moon is there, no voice, no sound<br>
Of beating heart; a sigh profound<br>
Once in each age as each age dies<br>
Alone is heard. Far, far it lies,<br>
As each age dies<br>
<br>
<i>[2x]</i><br>
Upon the plain, there rushed forth and high<br>
Shadows at dead end of night and mirrored in the sky<br>
Far, far away beyond might of day<br>
And there lay the land of dead of mortal cold decay<br>
<br>
<i>[2x]</i><br>
No moon is there, no voice, no sound<br>
Of beating heart; a sigh profound<br>
Once in each age as each age dies<br>
Alone is heard. Far, far it lies,<br>
As each age dies<br>
<br>
<i>[5x]</i><br>
Upon the plain, there rushed forth and high<br>
Shadows at dead end of night and mirrored in the sky<br>
Far, far away beyond might of day<br>
And there lay the land of dead of mortal cold decay<br>
<br><br>
