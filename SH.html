<h3><a name="1">1. Rhun</a></h3><br>
[instrumental]
<br><br>
<h3><a name="2">2. Long Lost To Where No Pathway Goes</a></h3><br>
My star, I saw it high and far<br>
At the parting of the ways<br>
A light on the edge of the outer night<br>
Like silver set ablaze<br>
Where the round world plunges steeply down<br>
But on the old roads goes<br>
As an unseen bridge that on arches runs<br>
To coasts that no man knows<br>
<br>
I would not find the burning domes and sands<br>
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows<br>
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men<br>
long lost to where no pathway goes<br>
<br>
But where they bloom those flowers fair<br>
In what air or land they grow<br>
What words beyond the world I heard<br>
If you would seek for know<br>
<br>
In a boat then, brother, far afloat<br>
You must labour in the sea<br>
And find yourself things out of mind:<br>
You will learn no more of me<br>
<br>
I would not find the burning domes and sands<br>
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the deadly snows<br>
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men<br>
Of long lost to where no pathway goes<br>
<br>
There the twain enfolded,<br>
Phantom twilight, phantom twilight,<br>
And dim the mazes dark, unholy,<br>
<br>
I would never find the burning domes and sands<br>
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows<br>
Nor seek in mountains dark, the landscapes of the men<br>
Long lost to whom no pathway goes<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="3">3. The Glory Disappears</a></h3><br>
Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves<br>
That break against the shore, shall lull my mind<br>
And scorn against all enemies prepared<br>
And with the food of pride sustained my soul<br>
In solitude<br>
<br>
Sad was I, to pain depressed<br>
Importunate and heavy load<br>
My destiny has found me here<br>
Upon this lonely road<br>
<br>
And many thousands now are sad<br>
Wait the fulfilment of their fear<br>
For I must die who is their stay<br>
Their glory disappears<br>
<br>
Now I am dead and gone, my friend<br>
Life's pain has come to end<br>
Your star will guide my soul<br>
To ride the winds above<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="4">4. Like Some Snow-White Marble Eyes</a></h3><br>
How countless they congregate<br>
O'er our tumultuous snow<br>
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees<br>
When wintry winds do blow<br>
<br>
Upon this star I fixed my eye<br>
And rode over the wide, wide lands<br>
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof<br>
He raced and never stopped again<br>
<br>
As if with keenness for our fate<br>
Our faltering few steps on<br>
To white rest, and a place of rest<br>
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate<br>
Those stars like some snow-white<br>
Like some snow-white marble eyes<br>
<br>
How countless they congregate<br>
O'er our tumultuous snow<br>
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees<br>
When wintry winds do blow<br>
<br>
Upon this star I fixed my eye<br>
And rode over the wide, wide lands<br>
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof<br>
He raced and never stopped again<br>
<br>
As if with keenness for our fate<br>
Our faltering few steps on<br>
To white rest, and a place of rest<br>
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate<br>
Those stars like some snow-white<br>
Like some snow-white marble eyes<br>
<br>
How countless they congregate<br>
O'er our tumultuous snow<br>
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees<br>
When wintry winds do blow<br>
<br>
Upon this star I fixed my eye<br>
And rode over the wide, wide lands<br>
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof<br>
He raced and never stopped again<br>
<br>
As if with keenness for our fate<br>
Our faltering few steps on<br>
To white rest, and a place of rest<br>
Yet tomorrow grows with no love or hate<br>
Those stars like some snow-white<br>
Like some snow-white marble eyes<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="5">5. Where Hope And Daylight Die</a></h3><br>
Still here I wake and I think of you<br>
I see you, I see you far away<br>
Answer my call,  can you hear my voice?<br>
I hear you...<br>
<br>
For we are gone and forever lost<br>
Broken I lie, broken here I lie<br>
Beneath, the shadows sink where daylight dies<br>
I wake for you...<br>
<br>
But here I stand and think of<br>
The days the grass was green and my heart was so young<br>
They've never been past -<br>
Forever lost...<br>
<br>
In better lands the sun may shine<br>
And green leaves on trees spring<br>
Opening in its blossoming<br>
And hear the raven sing...<br>
<br>
For we are gone and forever lost<br>
Broken I lie, broken here I lie<br>
Beneath, the shadows sink where daylight dies<br>
I wake for you...<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="6">6. The Rotting Horse On The Deadly Ground</a></h3><br>
Wars of great kings and clash of armouries<br>
Whose swords no man could tell, whose spears<br>
Were numerous as wheat field's ears<br>
Rolled over all the great lands, and seas<br>
Were loud with navies, their devouring fires<br>
Behind the armies burned both fields and towns<br>
And sacked and crumbled or to flaming pyres<br>
Were cities made, where treasuries and crowns<br>
Kings and their folk, their wives and tender maids<br>
Were all consumed. Now silent are those courts<br>
Ruined the towers, whose old shape slowly fades<br>
And no feet pass beneath their broken ports<br>
I need no call of clamant bell that rings<br>
Iron tongued in the towers of earthly kings<br>
Take a ride on, ride on,<br>
on your rotting horse<br>
on that deadly ground<br>
Take a ride, ride on,<br>
on your rotting horse<br>
with a pounding sound.<br>
Here on the stones and trees there lies a spell<br>
Of unforgotten loss, of memories more blest<br>
than mortal wealth.<br>
Here undefeated dwell the fog immortal<br>
under withered elmes,<br>
Alalminore one in ancient realms<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="7">7. The Shadow Lies Frozen On The Hills</a></h3><br>
Farewell we call to the earth and hall<br>
Though wind may blow so fast rain may fall<br>
We must away ere break of day<br>
For over wood, tree and mountain tall.<br>
<br>
With foes ahead, behind us dread<br>
Beneath the sky's our bed<br>
Until at last our toil be passed<br>
Our journey's done with sped<br>
<br>
Beneath the moon and under a tall star<br>
I wandered so far from northern lands<br>
Bewildered on enchanting charming ways<br>
So far from the days of mortal lands<br>
<br>
From gashing of the narrow ice so near<br>
Where shadows lie frozen on the hills top<br>
From neither heats and burning glowing waste<br>
I'm turning in haste and fear.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="8">8. The Loud Music Of The Sky</a></h3><br>
What I am, I must not show<br>
What I am thou could (not know)<br>
Something between heaven and hell<br>
Something that neither stood nor fell<br>
<br>
Far less happy, for we have<br>
Help nor hope beyond the grave<br>
And this is all that I can show<br>
And this is all that you may know<br>
<br>
A year there is a lifetime<br>
And a second but a day<br>
And an older would will meet you<br>
Each morn' you come away<br>
<br>
The thunder's noise is our delight<br>
And lightning makes us day by night<br>
And in the air we dance on high<br>
To the loud music of the sky<br>
<br>
Neither substance quite, nor shadow<br>
Haunting lonely moor and meadow<br>
Dancing by the haunted spring<br>
And riding on the whirlwinds wing<br>
<br>
A year there is a lifetime<br>
And a second but a day<br>
And an older would will meet you<br>
Each morn' you come away<br>
<br>
The thunder's noise is our delight<br>
And lightning makes us day by night<br>
And in the air we dance on high<br>
To the loud music of the sky<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="9">9. A Distant Flame Before The Sun</a></h3><br>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
Of how the world will be<br>
When winter comes without a spring<br>
That I shall ever see<br>
<br>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
Of people long ago<br>
And people who will see a world<br>
That I shall never know<br>
<br>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
Of older times that were before<br>
I listen for returning feet<br>
And voices at my door<br>
<br>
On high above the mists I came<br>
A distant flame before the sun<br>
A wonder ere the waking dawn<br>
Where grey the nordlands waters run<br>
In elder days and years of yore<br>
<br>
"Now behold the awful price of treason<br>
Through dreams I influence mankind".<br>
