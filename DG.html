<a name="1">1. Angbands Schmieden</a></h3><br>
<i>[INSTRUMENTAL]</i><br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="2">2. Nightshade Forests</a></h3><br>
And in the glade a light was seen<br>
Of stars and shadows shimmering<br>
Immortal maiden elven-wise...<br>
Long was the way through iron halls and darkling doors<br>
<br>
And woods of nightshade morrowless<br>
Elven-wise dance with me...<br>
Cold be hand, heart and bone<br>
And cold be my sleep under stone<br>
Never more I'll wake on a snowy bed<br>
Never - 'til the sun fails and the moon is dead<br>
<br>
In the black winds the stars shall die<br>
And still on gold here let them lie<br>
'Til the dark lord lifts his hand<br>
Over dead seas and withered land<br>
<br>
And I'll fly away...<br>
Where I dwell none can say<br>
For into darkness fell my star<br>
In Mordor where the shadows are<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="3">3. Elfstone</a></h3><br>
All that is gold does not glitter<br>
All that is long does not last<br>
All that is old does not wither<br>
Not all that is over is past<br>
And I may not get through in time<br>
Oh, Elfstone - bearer of my green stone<br>
In the south under snow a green stone thou shalt see<br>
Elfstone - in the shadow of the dark throne<br>
For the hour is at hand that long hath awaited thee<br>
Greenleaf - bearer of the Elvenbow<br>
Far beyond Mirkwood many trees on earth grow<br>
Thy last shaft when thou hast shot<br>
Under the mournful trees thou shalt walk<br>
For dark are the waters of Kheledzaram<br>
And my heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon<br>
I am longing for harmony - the freedom within me<br>
Out of dark to the day's rising<br>
I came crying in the sun - sword unsheathing<br>
To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking<br>
Now for wrath<br>
Now for ruin - and a red nightfall<br>
When the black breath blows - and death's shadows grow<br>
All lights pass<br>
Life to the dying - in my hand lying<br>
Shrivel like the old mist - like the winds go wailing<br>
Lost and forgotten be - darker than the darkness<br>
Where gates stand for ever shut<br>
'Til the world is mended<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="4">4. Khazad Dum</a></h3><br>
From ashes and fire be broken<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken<br>
The crownless shall again be king<br>
<br>
The world is grey, the mountains old<br>
The forge's fire is ashen and cold<br>
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls<br>
The darkness dwells in Druin's halls<br>
<br>
The shadow lies upon his tomb<br>
But still the sunken stars appeal<br>
In the dark and windless Mirrormere<br>
There lies his crown in water deep<br>
<br>
'Til Druin wakes again from sleep<br>
A deadly sword, a healing hand<br>
A trumpet - voice, a burning hand<br>
A lord of Wisdom...<br>
<br>
Fire and shadow - both defied<br>
In Khazad-Dum his wisdom died<br>
In joy thou hast lived<br>
<br>
If thou hearest the cry<br>
of the Gull on the shore<br>
Thy soul shall then rest<br>
in the forest no more...<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="5">5. Kor</a></h3><br>
O fading town upon an island hill,<br>
Old shadows linger in thine ancient gate,<br>
Thy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still;<br>
Thy towers silent in the mist await their crumbling end<br>
While through the storeyed elms<br>
The gliding black water leaves these inland realms,<br>
And slips between long meadows to the Sea,<br>
Still bearing downward over murmurous falls<br>
One day and then another to the Sea<br>
And slowly thither many years have gone<br>
<br>
All thy trees, Kortirion, were bent,<br>
And shook with sudden whispering lament:<br>
For passing were the days, and doomed the nights<br>
When flittering ghost-moths danced round<br>
tapers in the moveless air nighttime<br>
<br>
And doomed already were the radiant dawns,<br>
The odour and the noise of meads,<br>
when all thy trees were bent,<br>
and shook with sudden whispering lament<br>
<br>
And slowly thither many years have gone<br>
since first the elves here built ancient, renowned Kortirion<br>
<br><br>

<h3><a name="7">7. Unto A Long Glory...</a></h3><br>
Over the land there lies the long shadow.<br>
Westward reaching wings of darkness;<br>
The Tower trembles to the tombs of kings<br>
<br>
The doom approaches the Dead awaken;<br>
For the hour is come for the oathbreakers<br>
At the stone of Erech they shall stand again<br>
Hear there horn in hills enchants<br>
Who shall call them<br>
From grey twilight<br>
Forgotten ones?<br>
<br>
Out of doubt, out of dark<br>
Hope rekindles, and hope in end<br>
Over death, over dread<br>
Over doom lifted<br>
Out of loss, out of life<br>
And out of doubt, out of dark<br>
Over death, over dread<br>
Out of loss,<br>
Unto a long glory...<br>
<br>
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore<br>
From the North he shall come<br>
And he shall pass the door<br>
To the Paths of the  Dead<br>
<br>
Mourn not overmuch - mighty was the fallen<br>
And war now calls us!<br>
<br>
And hear there horn in hills ringing<br>
Who shall call them<br>
from grey twilight<br>
<br><br>
<h3><a name="8">8. Over Old Hills</a></h3><br>
The air was neither night or a day,<br>
But faintly dark with softest light<br>
When first glimmered into sight<br>
The Cottage of Lost Play<br>
<br>
You and me - we know that land<br>
And often have been there in<br>
The old days, old days<br>
The dark child and a fair<br>
Was it down the paths of firelight<br>
Dreams  in winter cold and white,<br>
Or in the blue-spun twilight, twilight hours<br>
The air was neither night or day,<br>
But faintly dark with softest light,<br>
When first there glimmered into sight<br>
The Cottage of Lost Play<br>
<br>
And why we never found the same<br>
Old cottage, or magic<br>
Track that leads between a silver sea,<br>
Between a silver sea<br>
And those old shores and gardens fair<br>
Where all things are that ever were -<br>
We know not, You and Me<br>
We know not, You and Me<br>
<br>
Those old shores and gardens fair<br>
Where all things are<br>
That ever were<br>
<br>
The air was neither night or day,<br>
But faintly dark with softest light,<br>
When first there glimmered into sight<br>
The Cottage of Lost Play<br>
And those old shores and gardens<br>
Where all things are that ever were<br>
We know not, You and Me,<br>
We know not, You and Me<br>
<br>
And these old shores<br>
And gardens fair<br>
Where all things are<br>
That ever were <i>[before]</i><br>
Air was neither night or day<br>
But faintly dark with softest light<br>
When first there glimmered<br>
The Cottage of Lost Play
